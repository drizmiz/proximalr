# proximalr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of proximalr is to create a comprehensive and user-friendly
package for proximal causal inference methods, i.e.Â those from all
negative control and proximal causal inference papers, with rich
vignettes. This package would not be created without the efforts of the
proximal causal inference group, which the compiler of this package
greatly appreciates.

**proximalr** is in development and currently covers barely nothing.

## Installation

You can install the development version of proximalr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("drizmiz/proximalr")
```

<!--
## Example

This should be a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem, if I 


```r
library(proximalr)
## basic example code
```
